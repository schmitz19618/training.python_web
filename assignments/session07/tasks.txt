Session 7 Homework
==================

We noted in class that it is awkward to have to add a post to a category,
instead of being able to designate a category for a post when authoring the
post. You will update your blog admin so that this is fixed.

Required Tasks
--------------

Take the following steps:

1. Read the documentation about the Django admin.
2. You'll need to create a customized ModelAdmin class for the Post and
   Category models.
3. And you'll need to create an InlineModelAdmin to represent Categories on the
   Post admin view.
4. Finally, you'll need to suppress the display of the 'posts' field on your
   Category admin view.

Optional Tasks
--------------

If you complete the above in less than 3-4 hours of work, consider looking into
other ways of customizing the admin.

Tasks you might consider:

* Change the admin index to say 'Categories' instead of 'Categorys'.
* Add columns for the date fields to the list display of Posts.
* Display the created and modified dates for your posts when viewing them in
  the admin.
* Add a column to the list display of Posts that shows the author.  For more
  fun, make this a link that takes you to the admin page for that user.
* For the biggest challenge, look into `admin actions`_ and add an action to
  the Post admin that allows you to bulk publish posts from the Post list
  display
