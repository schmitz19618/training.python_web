A Moment to Reflect
-------------------

We've been at this for a couple of days now.  We've learned a great deal:

.. class:: incremental

* Sockets, the TCP/IP Stack and Basic Mechanics
* Web Protocols and the Importance of Clear Communication
* APIs and Consuming Data from The Web
* CGI and WSGI and Getting Information to Your Dynamic Applications

.. class:: incremental

Everything we do from here out will be based on tools built using these
*foundational technologies*.


From Now On
-----------

Think of everything we do as sitting on top of WSGI

.. class:: incremental

This may not *actually* be true

.. class:: incremental

But we will always be working at that level of abstraction.


Frameworks
----------

From Wikipedia:

.. class:: center incremental

A web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to
support the development of dynamic websites, web applications and web
services. The framework aims to alleviate the overhead associated with common
activities performed in Web development. For example, many frameworks provide
libraries for database access, templating frameworks and session management,
and they often promote code reuse


What Does That *Mean*?
----------------------

You use a framework to build an application.

.. class:: incremental

A framework allows you to build different kinds of applications.

.. class:: incremental

A framework abstracts what needs to be abstracted, and allows control of the
rest.

.. class:: incremental

Think back over the last four sessions. What were your pain points? Which bits
do you wish you didn't have to think about?


Level of Abstraction
--------------------

This last part is important when it comes to choosing a framework

.. class:: incremental

* abstraction ‚àù 1/freedom
* The more they choose, the less you can
* *Every* framework makes choices in what to abstract
* *Every* framework makes *different* choices


Impedance Mismatch
------------------

.. class:: big-centered

Don't Fight the Framework


Python Web Frameworks
---------------------

There are scores of 'em (this is a partial list).

Choosing a Framework
--------------------

Many folks will tell you "<XYZ> is the **best** framework".

.. class:: incremental

In most cases, what they really mean is "I know how to use <XYZ>"

.. class:: incremental

In some cases, what they really mean is "<XYZ> fits my brain the best"

.. class:: incremental

What they usually forget is that everyone's brain (and everyone's use-case) is
different.


Cris' First Law of Frameworks
-----------------------------

.. class:: center

**Pick the Right Tool for the Job**

.. class:: incremental

First Corollary

.. class:: incremental center

The right tool is the tool that allows you to finish the job quickly and
correctly.

.. class:: incremental center

But how do you know which that one is?


Cris' Second Law of Frameworks
------------------------------

.. class:: big-centered

You can't know unless you try

.. class:: incremental center

so let's try


From Your Homework
------------------

During the week, you walked through an introduction to the *Flask* web
framework. You wrote a file that looked like this:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: small

    from flask import Flask
    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def hello_world():
        return 'Hello World!'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run()


The outcome
-----------

When you ran this file, you should have seen something like this in your
browser:

.. image:: img/flask_hello.png
    :align: center
    :width: 80%


What's Happening Here?
----------------------

Flask the framework provides a Python class called `Flask`. This class
functions as a single *application* in the WSGI sense.

.. class:: incremental

We know a WSGI application must be a *callable* that takes the arguments
*environ* and *start_response*.

.. class:: incremental

It has to call the *start_response* method, providing status and headers.

.. class:: incremental

And it has to return an *iterable* that represents the HTTP response body.


Under the Covers
----------------

In Python, an object is a *callable* if it has a ``__call__`` method.

.. container:: incremental

    Here's the ``__call__`` method of the ``Flask`` class:
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        def __call__(self, environ, start_response):
            """Shortcut for :attr:`wsgi_app`."""
            return self.wsgi_app(environ, start_response)

.. class:: incremental

As you can see, it calls another method, called ``wsgi_app``.  Let's follow
this down...


Flask.wsgi_app
--------------

.. code-block:: python
    :class: small

    def wsgi_app(self, environ, start_response):
        """The actual WSGI application.  
        ...
        """
        ctx = self.request_context(environ)
        ctx.push()
        error = None
        try:
            try:
                response = self.full_dispatch_request()
            except Exception as e:
                error = e
                response = self.make_response(self.handle_exception(e))
            return response(environ, start_response)
        #...

.. class:: incremental

``response`` is another WSGI app.  ``Flask`` is actually *middleware*


Abstraction Layers
------------------

Finally, way down in a package called *werkzeug*, we find this response object
and it's ``__call__`` method:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: small

    def __call__(self, environ, start_response):
        """Process this response as WSGI application.

        :param environ: the WSGI environment.
        :param start_response: the response callable provided by the WSGI
                               server.
        :return: an application iterator
        """
        app_iter, status, headers = self.get_wsgi_response(environ)
        start_response(status, headers)
        return app_iter


Common Threads
--------------

All Python web frameworks that operate under the WSGI spec will do this same
sort of thing.

.. class:: incremental

They have to do it.

.. class:: incremental

And these layers of abstraction allow you, the developer to focus only on the
thing that really matters to you.

.. class:: incremental

Getting input from a request, and returning a response.


A Quick Reminder
----------------

Over the week, in addition to walking through a Flask intro you did two other
tasks:

.. class:: incremental

You walked through a tutorial on the Python DB API2, and learned how
to use ``sqlite3`` to store and retrieve data.

.. class:: incremental

You also read a bit about ``Jinja2``, the templating language Flask
uses out of the box, and ran some code to explore its abilities.


Moving On
---------

Now it is time to put all that together.

.. class:: incremental

We'll spend this session building a "microblog" application.

.. class:: incremental

Let's dive right in.

.. class:: incremental

Start by activating your Flask virtualenv


Our Database
------------

We need first to define what an *entry* for our microblog might look like.

.. class:: incremental

Let's keep it a simple as possible for now.

.. class:: incremental

Create a new directory ``microblog``, and open a new file in it:
``schema.sql``

.. code-block:: sql
    :class: incremental small

    drop table if exists entries;
    create table entries (
        id integer primary key autoincrement,
        title string not null,
        text string not null
    );


App Configuration
-----------------

For any but the most trivial applications, you'll need some configuration.

.. class:: incremental

Flask provides a number of ways of loading configuration.  We'll be using a
config file

.. class:: incremental

Create a new file ``microblog.cfg`` in the same directory.  

.. code-block:: python
    :class: small incremental
    
    # application configuration for a Flask microblog
    DATABASE = 'microblog.db'


Our App Skeleton
----------------

Finally, we'll need a basic app skeleton to work from.

.. class:: incremental

Create one more file ``microblog.py`` in the same directory, and enter the
following:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: small incremental

    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    app.config.from_pyfile('microblog.cfg')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)


Test Your Work
--------------

This is enough to get us off the ground.

.. container:: incremental

    From a terminal in the ``microblog`` directory, run the app:
    
    .. class:: small
    
    ::

        (flaskenv)$ python microblog.py
        * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
        * Restarting with reloader

.. class:: incremental

Then point your browser at http://localhost:5000/

.. class:: incremental

What do you see in your browser?  In the terminal?  Why?


Creating the Database
---------------------

Quit the app with ``^C``. Then return to ``microblog.py`` and add the
following:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: incremental small

    # add this up at the top
    import sqlite3

    # add the rest of this below the app.config statement
    def connect_db():
        return sqlite3.connect(app.config['DATABASE'])

.. class:: incremental

This should look familiar. What will happen?

.. class:: incremental

This convenience method allows us to write our very first test.


Tests and TDD
-------------

.. class:: center

**If it isn't tested, it's broken**

.. class:: incremental

We are going to write tests at every step of this exercise using the
``unittest`` module.

.. class:: incremental

In your ``microblog`` folder create a ``microblog_tests.py`` file. 

.. class:: incremental

Open it in your editor.


Testing Setup
-------------

Add the following to provide minimal test setup.

.. code-block:: python
    :class: small

    import os
    import tempfile
    import unittest
    
    import microblog

    class MicroblogTestCase(unittest.TestCase):

        def setUp(self):
            db_fd = tempfile.mkstemp()
            self.db_fd, microblog.app.config['DATABASE'] = db_fd
            microblog.app.config['TESTING'] = True
            self.client = microblog.app.test_client()
            self.app = microblog.app


Testing Teardown
----------------

**Add** this method to your existing test case class to tear down after each
test:

.. code-block:: python

    class MicroblogTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
        # ...

        def tearDown(self):
            os.close(self.db_fd)
            os.unlink(microblog.app.config['DATABASE'])


Make Tests Runnable
-------------------

Finally, we make our tests runnable by adding a ``main`` block:

.. container:: incremental

    Add the following at the end of ``microblog_tests.py``:

    .. code-block:: python
        :class: small

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            unittest.main()

.. class:: incremental

Now, we're ready to add our first actual test..


Test Database Setup
-------------------

We'd like to test that our database is correctly initialized. The schema has
one table with three columns. Let's test that.

.. container:: incremental

    **Add** the following method to your test class in ``microblog_tests.py``:

    .. code-block:: python
        :class: small

        def test_database_setup(self):
            con = microblog.connect_db()
            cur = con.execute('PRAGMA table_info(entries);')
            rows = cur.fetchall()
            self.assertEquals(len(rows), 3)


Run the Tests
-------------

We can now run our test module:

.. class:: small

::

    (flaskenv)$ python microblog_tests.py
    F
    ======================================================================
    FAIL: test_database_setup (__main__.MicroblogTestCase)
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "microblog_tests.py", line 23, in test_database_setup
        self.assertEquals(len(rows) == 3)
    AssertionError: 0 != 3

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 1 test in 0.011s

    FAILED (failures=1)


Make the Test Pass
------------------

This is an expected failure. Why?

.. container:: incremental

    Let's add some code to ``microblog.py`` that will actually create our
    database schema:

    .. code-block:: python
        :class: small

        # add this import at the top
        from contextlib import closing

        # add this function after the connect_db function
        def init_db():
            with closing(connect_db()) as db:
                with app.open_resource('schema.sql') as f:
                    db.cursor().executescript(f.read())
                db.commit()


Initialize the DB in Tests
--------------------------

We also need to call that function in our ``microblog_tests.py`` to set up the
database schema for each test.

.. container:: incremental

    Add the following line at the end of that ``setUp`` method:

    .. code-block:: python
        :class: small

        def setUp(self):
            # ...
            microblog.init_db() # <- add this at the end

.. class:: incremental

::

    (flaskenv)$ python microblog_tests.py


Success?
--------

.. class:: big-centered incremental

 \\o/ Wahoooo!


Initialize the DB IRL
---------------------

Our test passed, so we have confidence that ``init_db`` does what it should

.. class:: incremental

We'll need to have a working database for our app, so let's go ahead and do
this "in real life"

.. class:: incremental

    (flaskenv)$ python

.. code-block:: python
    :class: incremental

    >>> import microblog
    >>> microblog.init_db()
    >>> ^D


First Break
-----------

After you quit the interpreter, you should see ``microblog.db`` in your 
directory.

.. class:: incremental

Let's take a few minutes here to rest and consider what we've done.

.. class:: incremental

When we return, we'll start writing data to our database, and reading it back
out.


Reading and Writing Data
------------------------

Before the break, we created a function that would initialize our database.

.. class:: incremental

It's time now to think about writing and reading data for our blog.

.. class:: incremental

We'll start by writing tests.

.. class:: incremental

But first, a word or two about the circle of life.


The Request/Response Cycle
--------------------------

Every interaction in HTTP is bounded by the interchange of one request and one
response.

.. class:: incremental

No HTTP application can do anything until some client makes a request.

.. class:: incremental

And no action by an application is complete until a response has been sent
back to the client.

.. class:: incremental

This is the lifecycle of an http web application.


Managing DB Connections
-----------------------

It makes sense to bind the lifecycle of a database connection to this same
border.

.. class:: incremental

Flask does not dictate that we write an application that uses a database.

.. class:: incremental

Because of this, managing the lifecycle of database connection so that they
are connected to the request/response cycle is up to us.

.. class:: incremental

Happily, Flask *does* have a way to help us.


Request Boundary Decorators
---------------------------

The Flask *app* provides decorators we can use on our database lifecycle
functions:

.. class:: incremental

* ``@app.before_request``: any method decorated by this will be called before
  the cycle begins

* ``@app.after_request``: any method decorated by this will be called after
  the cycle is complete. If an unhandled exception occurs, these functions are
  skipped.

* ``@app.teardown_request``: any method decorated by this will be called at
  the end of the cycle, *even if* an unhandled exception occurs.


Managing our DB
---------------

Consider the following functions:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: small

    def get_database_connection():
        db = connect_db()
        return db

    @app.teardown_request
    def teardown_request(exception):
        db.close()

.. class:: incremental

How does the ``db`` object get from one place to the other?


Global Context in Flask
-----------------------

Our flask ``app`` is only really instantiated once

.. class:: incremental

This means that anything we tie to it will be shared across all requests.

.. class:: incremental

This is what we call ``global`` context.

.. class:: incremental

What happens if two clients make a request at the same time?


Local Context in Flask
----------------------

Flask provides something it calls a ``local global``: "g".

.. class:: incremental

This is an object that *looks* global (you can import it anywhere)

.. class:: incremental

But in reality, it is *local* to a single request.

.. class:: incremental

Resources tied to this object are *not* shared among requests. Perfect for
things like a database connection.


Working DB Functions
--------------------

Add the following, working methods to ``microblog.py``:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: small

    # add this import at the top:
    from flask import g

    # add these function after init_db
    def get_database_connection():
        db = getattr(g, 'db', None)
        if db is None:
            g.db = db = connect_db()
        return db

    @app.teardown_request
    def teardown_request(exception):
        db = getattr(g, 'db', None)
        if db is not None:
            db.close()


Writing Blog Entries
--------------------

Our microblog will have *entries*. We've set up a simple database schema to
represent them.

.. class:: incremental

To write an entry, what would we need to do?

.. class:: incremental

* Provide a title
* Provide some body text
* Write them to a row in the database

.. class:: incremental

Let's write a test of a function that would do that.


Test Writing Entries
--------------------

The database connection is bound by a request. We'll need to mock one (in
``microblog_tests.py``)

.. container:: incremental

    Flask provides ``app.test_request_context`` to do just that

    .. code-block:: python
        :class: small

        def test_write_entry(self):
            expected = ("My Title", "My Text")
            with self.app.test_request_context('/'):
                microblog.write_entry(*expected)
                con = microblog.connect_db()
                cur = con.execute("select * from entries;")
                rows = cur.fetchall()
            self.assertEquals(len(rows), 1)
            for val in expected:
                self.assertTrue(val in rows[0])


Run Your Test
-------------

.. class:: small

::

    (flaskenv)$ python microblog_tests.py
    .E

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 2 tests in 0.018s

    FAILED (errors=1)

.. class:: incremental

Great.  Two tests, one passing.


Make It Pass
------------

Now we are ready to write an entry to our database. Add this function to
``microblog.py``:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: small incremental

    def write_entry(title, text):
        con = get_database_connection()
        con.execute('insert into entries (title, text) values (?, ?)',
                     [title, text])
        con.commit()

.. class:: incremental small

::

    (flaskenv)$ python microblog_tests.py
    ..
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 2 tests in 0.146s

    OK


Reading Entries
---------------

We'd also like to be able to read the entries in our blog

.. container:: incremental

    We need a method that returns all of them for a listing page

    .. class:: incremental

    * The return value should be a list of entries
    * If there are none, it should return an empty list
    * Each entry in the list should be a dictionary of 'title' and 'text'

.. class:: incremental

Let's begin by writing tests.


Test Reading Entries
--------------------

In ``microblog_tests.py``:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: small

    def test_get_all_entries_empty(self):
        with self.app.test_request_context('/'):
            entries = microblog.get_all_entries()
            self.assertEquals(len(entries), 0)
    
    def test_get_all_entries(self):
        expected = ("My Title", "My Text")
        with self.app.test_request_context('/'):
            microblog.write_entry(*expected)
            entries = microblog.get_all_entries()
            self.assertEquals(len(entries), 1)
            for entry in entries:
                self.assertEquals(expected[0], entry['title'])
                self.assertEquals(expected[1], entry['text'])


Run Your Tests
--------------

.. class:: small

::

    (flaskenv)$ python microblog_tests.py

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 4 tests in 0.021s

    FAILED (errors=2)

Make Them Pass
--------------

Now we have 4 tests, and two fail.

.. class:: incremental

add the ``get_all_entries`` function to ``microblog.py``:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: small incremental

    def get_all_entries():
        con = get_database_connection()
        cur = con.execute('SELECT title, text FROM entries ORDER BY id DESC')
        return [dict(title=row[0], text=row[1]) for row in cur.fetchall()]

.. container:: incremental

    And back in your terminal:
    
    .. class:: small
    
    ::

        (flaskenv)$ python microblog_tests.py
        ....
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Ran 4 tests in 0.021s

        OK


Where We Stand
--------------

We've moved quite a ways in implementing our microblog:

.. class:: incremental

* We've created code to initialize our database schema
* We've added functions to manage the lifecycle of our database connection
* We've put in place functions to write and read blog entries
* And, since it's tested, we are reasonably sure our code does what we think
  it does.

.. class:: incremental

We're ready now to put a face on it, so we can see what we're doing!


Second Break
------------

But first, let's take a quick break to clear our heads.


Templates In Flask
------------------

We'll start with a detour into templates as they work in Flask

.. container:: incremental

    Jinja2 templates use the concept of an *Environment* to:
    
    .. class:: incremental
    
    * Figure out where to look for templates
    * Set configuration for the templating system
    * Add some commonly used functionality to the template *context*

.. class:: incremental

Flask sets up a proper Jinja2 Environment when you instantiate your ``app``.


Flask Environment
-----------------

Flask uses the value you pass to the ``app`` constructor to calculate the root
of your application on the filesystem.

.. class:: incremental

From that root, it expects to find templates in a directory name ``templates``

.. container:: incremental

    This allows you to use the ``render_template`` command from ``flask`` like
    so:
    
    .. code-block:: python
        :class: small
    
        from flask import render_template
        page_html = render_template('hello_world.html', name="Cris")


Flask Context
-------------

Keyword arguments you pass to ``render_template`` become the *context* passed
to the template for rendering.

.. class:: incremental

Flask will add a few things to this context.

.. class:: incremental

* **config**: contains the current configuration object
* **request**: contains the current request object
* **session**: any session data that might be available
* **g**: the request-local object to which global variables are bound
* **url_for**: so you can easily *reverse* urls from within your templates
* **get_flashed_messages**: a function that returns messages you flash to your
  users (more on this later).


Setting Up Our Templates
------------------------

In your ``microblog`` directory, add a new ``templates`` directory

.. container:: incremental

    In this directory create a new file ``layout.html``

    .. code-block:: jinja
        :class: small
    
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>Microblog!</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <h1>My Microblog</h1>
            <div class="content">
            {% block body %}{% endblock %}
            </div>
          </body>
        </html>

Template Inheritance
--------------------

You can combine templates in a number of different ways.

.. class:: incremental

* you can make replaceable blocks in templates with blocks

  * ``{% block foo %}{% endblock %}``

* you can build on a template in a second template by extending

  * ``{% extends "layout.html" %}`` 
  * this *must* be the first text in the template

* you can re-use common structure with *include*:

  * ``{% include "footer.html" %}``


Displaying an Entries List
--------------------------

Create a new file, ``show_entries.html`` in ``templates``:

.. code-block:: jinja
    :class: small

    {% extends "layout.html" %}
    {% block body %}
      <h2>Posts</h2>
      <ul class="entries">
      {% for entry in entries %}
        <li>
          <h2>{{ entry.title }}</h2>
          <div class="entry_body">
          {{ entry.text|safe }}
          </div>
        </li>
      {% else %}
        <li><em>No entries here so far</em></li>
      {% endfor %}
      </ul>
    {% endblock %}


Viewing Entries
---------------

We just need a Python function that will: 

.. class:: incremental

* build a list of entries
* pass the list to our template to be rendered
* return the result to a client's browser

.. class:: incremental

As usual, we'll start by writing tests for this new function


Test Viewing Entries
--------------------

Add the following two tests to ``microblog_tests.py``:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: small

    def test_empty_listing(self):
        actual = self.client.get('/').data
        expected = 'No entries here so far'
        self.assertTrue(expected in actual)

    def test_listing(self):
        expected = ("My Title", "My Text")
        with self.app.test_request_context('/'):
            microblog.write_entry(*expected)
        actual = self.client.get('/').data
        for value in expected:
            self.assertTrue(value in actual)

.. class:: incremental

``app.test_client()`` creates a mock http client for us.


Run Your Tests
--------------

.. class:: small

    (flaskenv)$ python microblog_tests.py
    .F..F.

    Ran 6 tests in 0.138s

    FAILED (failures=2)


Make Them Pass
--------------

In ``microblog.py``:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: small

    # at the top, import
    from flask import render_template

    # and after our last functions:
    @app.route('/')
    def show_entries():
        entries = get_all_entries()
        return render_template('show_entries.html', entries=entries)

.. class:: incremental small

::

    (flaskenv)$ python microblog_tests.py
    ......
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 6 tests in 0.100s

    OK


Creating Entries
----------------

We still lack a way to add an entry. We need a view that will:

.. class:: incremental

* Accept incoming form data from a request
* Get the data for ``title`` and ``text``
* Create a new entry in the database
* Throw an appropriate HTTP error if that fails
* Show the user the list of entries when done.

.. class:: incremental

Again, first come the tests.


Testing Add an Entry
--------------------

Add this to ``microblog_tests.py``:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: small

    def test_add_entries(self):
        actual = self.client.post('/add', data=dict(
            title='Hello',
            text='This is a post'
        ), follow_redirects=True).data
        self.assertFalse('No entries here so far' in actual)
        self.assertTrue('Hello' in actual)
        self.assertTrue('This is a post' in actual)


Run Your Tests
--------------

Verify that our test fails as expected:

.. class:: small

::

    (flaskenv)$ python microblog_tests.py
    F......
    ======================================================================
    FAIL: test_add_entries (__main__.MicroblogTestCase)
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "microblog_tests.py", line 72, in test_add_entries
        self.assertTrue('Hello' in actual)
    AssertionError: False is not true

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 7 tests in 0.050s

    FAILED (failures=1)


Make Them Pass
--------------

We have all we need to write entries, all we lack is an endpoint (in
``microblog.py``):

.. code-block:: python
    :class: small

    # add imports
    from flask import abort
    from flask import request
    from flask import url_for
    from flask import redirect

    @app.route('/add', methods=['POST'])
    def add_entry():
        try:
            write_entry(request.form['title'], request.form['text'])
        except sqlite3.Error:
            abort(500)
        return redirect(url_for('show_entries'))


And...?
-------

.. class:: small

::

    (flaskenv)$ python microblog_tests.py
    .......
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 7 tests in 0.047s

    OK

.. class:: incremental center

**Hooray!**


Where do Entries Come From
--------------------------

Finally, we're almost done. We can add entries and view them. But look at that
last view. Do you see a call to ``render_template`` in there at all?

.. class:: incremental

There isn't one. That's because that view is never meant to be be visible.
Look carefully at the logic. What happens?

.. class:: incremental

So where do the form values come from?

.. class:: incremental

Let's add a form to the main view.  Open ``show_entries.html``


Provide a Form
--------------

.. code-block:: jinja
    :class: small

    {% block body %}  <!-- already there -->
    <form action="{{ url_for('add_entry') }}" method="POST" class="add_entry">
      <div class="field">
        <label for="title">Title</label>
        <input type="text" size="30" name="title" id="title"/>
      </div>
      <div class="field">
        <label for="text">Text</label>
        <textarea name="text" id="text" rows="5" cols="80"></textarea>
      </div>
      <div class="control_row">
        <input type="submit" value="Share" name="Share"/>
      </div>
    </form>
    <h2>Posts</h2>  <!-- already there -->


All Done
--------

Okay.  That's it.  We've got an app all written.

.. class:: incremental

So far, we haven't actually touched our browsers at all, but we have
reasonable certainty that this works because of our tests. Let's try it.


.. class:: incremental

In the terminal where you've been running tests, run our microblog app:

.. class:: incremental

::

    (flaskenv)$ python microblog.py
    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    * Restarting with reloader


The Big Payoff
--------------

Now load ``http://localhost:5000/`` in your browser and enjoy your reward.


Making It Pretty
----------------

What we've got here is pretty ugly.

.. class:: incremental

If you've fallen behind, or want to start fresh, you can find the finished
``microblog`` directory in the class resources.

.. class:: incremental

In that directory inside the ``static`` directory you will find
``styles.css``. Open it in your editor.  It contains basic CSS for this app.

.. class:: incremental

We'll need to include this file in our ``layout.html``.


Static Files
------------

Like page templates, Flask locates static resources like images, css and
javascript by looking for a ``static`` directory relative to the app root.

.. class:: incremental

You can use the special url endpoint ``static`` to build urls that point here.
Open ``layout.html`` and add the following:

.. code-block:: jinja
    :class: small incremental

    <head>  <!-- you only need to add the <link> below -->
      <title>Flaskr</title>
      <link href="{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
    </head>


Reap the Rewards
----------------

Make sure that your `microblog` folder has a `static` folder inside it, and
that the `styles.css` file is in it.

.. class:: incremental

Then, reload your web browser and see the difference a bit of style can make.

Homework
--------

We've built a simple microblog application in the *Flask* web framework.

.. class:: incremental

For your homework this week I'd like you to add two features to this app.

.. class:: incremental

1. Authentication
2. Flash messaging


Authentication Specifications
-----------------------------

Writing new entries should be restricted to users who have logged in. This
means that:

.. class:: incremental

* The form to create a new entry should only be visible to logged in users
* There should be a visible link to allow a user to log in
* This link should display a login form that expects a username and password
* If the user provides incorrect login information, this form should tell her
  so.
* If the user provides correct login information, she should end up at the
  list page
* Once logged in, the user should see a link to log out.
* Upon clicking that link, the system should no longer show the entry form and
  the log in link should re-appear.


Flash Messaging Specifications
------------------------------

A flask app provides a method called `flash` that allows passing messages from
a view function into a template context so that they can be viewed by a user.

.. class:: incremental

Use this method to provide the following messages to users:

.. class:: incremental

* Upon a successful login, display the message "You are logged in"
* Upon a successful logout, display the message "You have logged out"
* Upon posting a successful new entry, display the message "New entry posted"
* If adding an entry causes an error, instead of returning a 500 response,
  alert the user to the error by displaying the error message to the user.


Resources to Use
----------------

The microblog we created today comes from the tutorial on the `flask` website.
I've modified that tutorial to omit authentication and flash messaging. You can
refer to the tutorial and to the flask api documentation to learn what you need
to accomplish these tasks.

`The Flask Tutorial <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/tutorial/>`_

`Flask API Documentation <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/api/>`_

Both features depend on *sessions*, so you will want to pay particular
attention to how a session is enabled and what you can do with it once it
exists.


Next Week
---------

Next week we are going to mix things up a little and do something quite
different.

.. class:: incremental

We'll be starting from the app you have just built (with the additional
features you complete over the week).

.. class:: incremental

We will divide into pairs and each pair will select one feature from a list I
will provide.

.. class:: incremental

We'll spend the entire class implementing this feature, and at 8:15, each pair
will show their work to the class.


Wrap-Up
-------

For educational purposes you might try taking a look at the source code for
Flask and Werkzeug.  Neither is too large a package.

.. class:: incremental

In particular seeing how Werkzeug sets up a Request and Response--and how
these relate to the WSGI specification--can be very enlightening.
